# BestShop

This is a learning project from the CodersLab team. It is a webpage written based on a design in Adobe XD.

I used this project to practice HTML5 and learn about SCSS.

I had a lot of fun trying to figure out how to lay sections and details out according to the design, while keeping everything responsive and looking good on different screen sizes.
